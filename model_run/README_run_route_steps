Steps for running the modified routing model:

#=================================================
# (1) Prepare routing param files
#=================================================
1. Run './process/route_RBM/create_flowdir_smaller_asc.scr' 
	(Need to change the parameter section in the code)
	* create flow direction file required by the modified routing model
	* copy the flow direction file to the route param directory

2. Prepare Mohseni param files
	Run './process/route_RBM/create_Mohseni_files.scr' (Need to change the parameter section in the code)
	* This creates Mohseni param files needed for preparing RBM input
	* Currently, each Mohseni parameter is set to spatially constant
	* Param files are the same size as flow direction file (input to the modified routing mode)


#2. Create topology file
#	Run command: perl ./process/route_RBM/
