The steps of running VIC is:

1. Run './process/vic/select_vic_soil_param.scr'
	(Need to change the parameter section in the code)
	This create a smaller soil param file including grid cells that need to be run

2. Prepare VIC global files
	Global files are put in the directory: ./control/vic/
	Note:
		This step needs to be manually done
		The output section must be kept the same as in ./control/vic/Yakima_Mabtom.vic.global.1990_1995  (2 output files per grid cell, daily output, with header). RBM requires header and daily flow output. Energy output can be subdaily, but generating subdaily energy flux files need a separate VIC run.

3. Post-process VIC energy output - deleting the date columns
	Run './process/vic/delet_dates_in_VICoutput.scr' (Need the change the parameter section in the code)
	This deletes the date columns in the VIC energy output files, which is required by RBM
