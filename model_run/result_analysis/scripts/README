control_cmp_flow.py / control_cmp_streamT.py
	read in information of interested loacations;
	for each location, call 'cmp_flow.py' and 'cmp_streamT.py' to plot flow and stream T against USGS observations

cmp_flow.py
	plot flow data from RBM output and compare with USGS streamflow

plot_flow_future.py
	plot flow for comparing seasonality and average annual mean flow of climate scenarios and historical/control run

calc_MultiModelAvg_Lohmann.py
	calculate multi model average of Lohmann daily output;
	the results of this script can be feeded in to 'plot_flow_future.py' or 'control_plot_flow_future.py' for plotting multi-model-average climate scenario results
