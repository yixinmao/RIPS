Control files for running step 1-6 for preparing routing/RBM param and config files

NOTE:

0. Copy control file if make changes!!!

1. Tennessee_Maurer_8th_1949_2010.control is an old version of control file. Don't copy this one!!!

2. The control scripts must be run in the upper level directory (i.e., .../model_run/process/route_RBM)

3. After running the control script, check the files under [process_output_dir]/to_copy_[run_code], and copy them to the correct directories; make directory 'uh_s' under the route param directory
