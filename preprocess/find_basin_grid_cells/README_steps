Steps for finding all upstream grid cells of a given outlet:

Input: 
	1) ascii flow direction file bigger than the whole watershed (Lohmann routing format)
	2) outlet lat and lon (RVIC input format)

Step 0. Create RVIC (parameter run) input files
#========= only need to be run once for each flow direction file ============#
	Run './scripts/create_RVIC_input.scr' (Need to change the parameter section in the code)
	Note: 
		This creates the two fake param files (route and domain) RVIC needs
		This script only needs to be run once for each big direction file (the generated param files can be put under 'input')

Step 1. Run RVIC (parameter run)
	Run './scripts/run_RVIC_param.scr'  (Need to change the parameter section in the code)
	(This script runs RVIC (parameter part) to generate complete watershed mask)

Step 2. Generate a list of VIC grid cells to be run within the basin
	Run './scripts/create_grid_cell_list.py'  (Need to change the parameter section in the code)
	(This script outputs a list of lat lon that are within the basin)

Step 3. Check if the results make sense!!!
